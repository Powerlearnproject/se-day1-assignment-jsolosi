#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the design, creation, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software and software systems.
Its importance include:
Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
Scalability,flexibility and Maintainability - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance and designs software to be easily updated and expanded, crucial for long-term success and adaptability.
Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.
User Satisfaction - it focuses on user-centered design and rigorous testing to deliver products that provide a positive user experience and meet business objectives.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Introduction of Structured Methodologies:
The introduction of structured methodologies marked a significant milestone in software engineering. These methodologies provided frameworks for managing and executing software projects, bringing order and discipline to the development process. This shift helped in streamlining software creation and improving the overall quality and reliability of software systems 
2.Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
The advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized how software systems are designed, developed, and maintained. OOP introduced concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, which significantly improved code quality, reusability, and productivity. This paradigm shift enabled developers to create more modular and maintainable software systems 
3.Development of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
The introduction of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) was a major milestone in software engineering. IDEs provided a comprehensive suite of tools for coding, debugging, and testing, all within a single interface. This greatly enhanced developer productivity and efficiency, making the software development process more integrated and cohesive.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification, that is, gather requirements from stakeholders, and determine the feasibility of the project.
Design - building the framework which include, developing architectural diagrams, design databases, and define system interfaces. 
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - Verify that the software meets the requirements and functions as expected, examining the software for any bugs and glitches.
Deployment- Install the software, configure the environment, and train users.
Maintenance- Monitor system performance, fix bugs, and implement enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology - Waterfall is a traditional, linear project management approach where each phase of development must be completed before the next one begins.
- There is Low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile methodology - Agile, on the other hand, is a flexible, iterative development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid, incremental progress. It is built on continuous improvement and adaptability with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- Collaborating with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to ensure the software meets the desired functionality and quality standards.
- Reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
- Confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- Develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - Assembles and leads the software development team.
 - Discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - Create blueprint for the project.
 - Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - Deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode),JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA etc
Importance: 
- IDEs provide features like code auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection. This helps developers write code faster and reduces the chances of making mistakes.
- An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
- IDEs often include refactoring tools that help developers improve code structure without changing its functionality. Automatic code formatting ensures consistency in style, which is crucial in team projects.
- An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
-  IDEs often include tools for automating the build process (compiling, testing, and deploying). This simplifies complex tasks and ensures consistency in building the software.
-  The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
-   IDEs offer project navigation, file management, and task management features that make it easier to organize and work on large software projects.
    Version Control Systems (VCS) are crucial for managing changes to the codebase, ensuring code integrity, and facilitating collaboration among developers. eg Git, Subversion etc
Importance:
- Collaboration:  VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
- Error Tracking: VCS records every change, making it easier to identify and rectify errors. This audit trail is invaluable for understanding the evolution of the code and identifying the root cause of issues.
- Rollback Capability: VCS allows developers to roll back to previous versions of the code, which is particularly crucial when working with large development teams or complex projects.
- Branching and Merging: VCS enables developers to create branches to work on features or fixes independently. Once the work is complete, it can be merged back into the main codebase. This allows for parallel development of different features or versions of the software.
- Backup and Recovery: With VCS, developers can restore previous versions of code, ensuring that if something breaks, they can revert to a working state. This provides a safety net and reduces the risk of losing important work.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Tight Deadlines and Time Management- Software engineers often face tight deadlines, which can lead to rushed work and potential quality issues.
Strategies:
Adopt Agile Methodologies: Use frameworks like Scrum to break down projects into manageable sprints, enhancing productivity and ensuring deadlines are met without compromising quality.
Effective Time Management: Prioritize tasks, set realistic timelines, and use project management tools to track progress efficiently.
-Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Strategies: Software engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
-Communication Issues with Stakeholders- Effective communication with stakeholders is crucial but can be challenging due to differing expectations and technical jargon.
Strategies:
Regular Meetings: Schedule regular meetings to discuss progress, address concerns, and ensure everyone is aligned with project goals.
Clear Documentation: Maintain clear and concise documentation to facilitate understanding and reduce miscommunication.
-Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Strategy: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats.
-Staying Updated with Evolving Technologies- The rapid pace of technological evolution requires continuous learning and adaptation.
Strategies:
Professional Development: Engage in continuous learning through courses, workshops, and certifications.
Community Engagement: Participate in developer communities and forums to stay informed about the latest trends and technologies.
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Strategy: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of the software in isolation. The goal is to verify that each unit of the software performs as expected.
Importance:
-Identifies and fixes bugs early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort of debugging later.
-Ensures that each unit of code is reliable and meets the specified requirements.
-Allows developers to refactor code with confidence, knowing that existing functionality is preserved.
Integration testing involves testing the interaction between integrated units or modules. The goal is to ensure that the combined parts of the application work together as expected.
Importance:
-Verifies that the interfaces between modules are functioning correctly.
-Ensures that the integrated units work together to achieve the desired functionality.
-Identifies issues that arise from the interaction between modules, which may not be apparent in unit testing.
System testing involves testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Importance:
-Validates the entire system's functionality, performance, and reliability and security.
-Ensures that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
-Evaluates the system's usability and user experience in a real-world scenario.
Acceptance testing are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
Importance:
-Ensures that the system meets the expectations and requirements of the stakeholders.
-Provides a final check before the system is deployed to production.
-Ensures that the system is user-friendly and meets the needs of the end-users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
Customization and Control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.
Improving Model Interpretability- Helps in understanding AI behavior by analyzing how different prompts affect responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
